## Introduction
### ECG waveform simulation and analysis

This set of examples focuses on the simulation and analysis of Electrocardiogram (ECG) waveforms to study Heart Rate Variability (HRV) in a controlled, simulated environment. Using custom R functions for ECG waveform generation, we explore the effects of different conditions (control vs. case groups) on HRV, incorporating covariates such as age, sex, and treatment types in our analysis. The goal is to illustrate the application of statistical or machine learning methods, including Generalized Linear Models (GLM), to understand the potential influences on heart rate signals.

### Features

- **ECG Simulation**: Utilizing logistic map-based simulations to generate synthetic ECG waveforms, mimicking real heart rate variability patterns.
- **Peak Detection**: Implementing basic algorithms to identify R peaks within the ECG waveforms, a critical step for HRV analysis.
- **Covariate Integration**: Including simulated demographic and treatment data to examine the broader impacts on HRV.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Applying t-tests for initial comparisons and GLMs to account for multiple covariates, aiming to uncover any significant differences in HRV between groups.
- **Visualization**: `ggplot2` for  visualization of ECG data, analysis results, and the effects of covariates.

## Illustration of ECG wave
### Prepare dataset

* Initial setup for ECG waveform simulation.
* Define the total number of heartbeats and other parameters for ECG simulation.

```{r}
T <- 3  # Total heart beats
P1 <- 0.5  # Starting value for the logistic map
r <- 3.0  # Logistic map parameter
cons <- 0.0  # Constant added to logistic map output
SAMPLING_RATE <- 125  # Sampling rate for the ECG in Hz
```

* Simulate ECG data
* Generate P vector using logistic map
```{r}
P <- numeric(T)
P[1] <- P1
for (i in 2:T) {
  P[i] <- r * P[i - 1] * (1 - P[i - 1])
}
P <- P + cons
```

* Convert P vector to Q vector and simulate ECG waveform
```{r}
Q <- cumsum(P)
ecg <- fit_ecg_waves_to_beats(Q, sampling_rate=SAMPLING_RATE)
t <- seq_along(ecg) / SAMPLING_RATE
```

* Plot simulated ECG waveform
```{r}
ecg_data <- data.frame(Time = t, ECG = ecg)
head(ecg_data)
```

### Peak detection
* Step 1: Detect peaks - Find local maxima
* A simple approach to find local maxima (peaks)
```{r}
find_peaks <- function(ecg_data) {
  peaks <- which(diff(sign(diff(ecg_data$ECG))) == -2) + 1
  peak_data <- ecg_data[peaks, ]
  return(peak_data)
}

peak_data <- find_peaks(ecg_data)
```

* Step 2: Filter peaks by separation - ensure they are at least 0.4s apart (assumption)
* Sort peaks by amplitude to get the highest peaks first

```{r}
sorted_peaks <- peak_data[order(-peak_data$ECG), ]
filtered_peaks <- sorted_peaks[1, ]  # Initialize with the highest peak

for (i in 2:nrow(sorted_peaks)) {
  if (all(abs(filtered_peaks$Time - sorted_peaks$Time[i]) >= 0.4)) {
    filtered_peaks <- rbind(filtered_peaks, sorted_peaks[i, ])
    if (nrow(filtered_peaks) == 2) break  # Stop after finding the second peak
  }
}
```

* Step 3: Plot and annotate the ECG waveform with R peaks

```{r}
p <- ggplot(ecg_data, aes(x = Time, y = ECG)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point(data = filtered_peaks, aes(x = Time, y = ECG), color = "red", size = 3) +
  geom_text(data = filtered_peaks, aes(x = Time, y = ECG, label = "R"), vjust = -2, color = "red") +
  labs(title = "Simulated ECG Waveform with R Peak detection", x = "Time (s)", y = "Amplitude (mV)") +
  theme_minimal()

# print(p)

# Calculate the time difference between the two peaks
if (nrow(filtered_peaks) >= 2) {
  time_diff <- diff(filtered_peaks$Time)
  time_diff_label <- paste(round(time_diff, 2), "s")

  # Coordinates for annotation placement
  x_midpoint <- sum(filtered_peaks$Time) / 2
  y_max <- max(ecg_data$ECG) * 1.1

  # Add a line connecting the two peaks and annotate it with the time difference
  p <- p + geom_segment(aes(x = filtered_peaks$Time[1], y = max(ECG),
                            xend = filtered_peaks$Time[2], yend = max(ECG)),
                        linetype = "dashed", color = "blue") +
    annotate("text", x = x_midpoint, y = y_max, label = time_diff_label, color = "blue")
}

print(p)
```

## Example of full dataset

* Initial setup for ECG waveform simulation
```{r}
# Define the total number of heartbeats and other parameters for ECG simulation

T <- 20  # Total heart beats
P1 <- 0.5  # Starting value for the logistic map
r <- 3.0  # Logistic map parameter
cons <- 0.0  # Constant added to logistic map output
SAMPLING_RATE <- 125  # Sampling rate for the ECG in Hz
```

* Simulate ECG data.
* Generate P vector using logistic map.
```{r}
P <- numeric(T)
P[1] <- P1
for (i in 2:T) {
  P[i] <- r * P[i - 1] * (1 - P[i - 1])
}
P <- P + cons
```

* Convert P vector to Q vector and simulate ECG waveform
```{r}
Q <- cumsum(P)
ecg <- fit_ecg_waves_to_beats(Q, sampling_rate=SAMPLING_RATE)
t <- seq_along(ecg) / SAMPLING_RATE
```

* Plot simulated ECG waveform
```{r}
ecg_data <- data.frame(Time = t, ECG = ecg)

ggplot(ecg_data, aes(x = Time, y = ECG)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "Simulated ECG Waveform", x = "Time (s)", y = "Amplitude (mV)") +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Simulate HRV data for case/control study

* Simulate RR intervals with variability for two groups: control and case
```{r}
N <- 100  # Number of RR intervals per group
control_rr <- simulate_rr_intervals_group(N, 0.8, 0.05, "Control")
case_rr <- simulate_rr_intervals_group(N, 0.8, 0.15, "Case")
hrv_data <- rbind(control_rr, case_rr)
```

* Summarize HRV metrics for each group
```{r}
hrv_summary <- hrv_data |>
  group_by(Group) |>
  summarise(Mean_RR = mean(RR_Interval),
            SDNN = sd(RR_Interval),
            RMSSD = sqrt(mean(diff(RR_Interval)^2)))

head(hrv_summary)
```

* Plot HRV data showing RR interval variability between groups
```{r}
ggplot(hrv_data, aes(x = Group, y = RR_Interval)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.5, width = 0.3, height = 0) +
  labs(title = "RR Interval Variability by Group", x = "Group", y = "RR Interval (s)") +
  theme_minimal()
```

* Assess distribution of RR intervals for normality
```{r} 
# Plot histograms and Q-Q plots for visual inspection
ggplot(hrv_data, aes(x = RR_Interval, fill = Group)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 30, alpha = 0.6) +
  facet_wrap(~Group) +
  labs(title = "Distribution of RR Intervals by Group", x = "RR Interval (s)", y = "Count") +
  theme_minimal()

# Q-Q plots for Control and Case groups using ggplot2
ggplot(hrv_data, aes(sample = RR_Interval)) +
  stat_qq() +
  stat_qq_line() +
  ggtitle("Q-Q Plot for Control Group") +
  theme_minimal() +
  facet_grid(.~Group, scales="free")
```

* Perform Shapiro-Wilk test for normality
```{r}
shapiro_test_control <- shapiro.test(hrv_data$RR_Interval[hrv_data$Group == "Control"])
shapiro_test_case <- shapiro.test(hrv_data$RR_Interval[hrv_data$Group == "Case"])
print(shapiro_test_control)
print(shapiro_test_case)
```

* Decision on statistical test based on normality assessment
*  If normality is not rejected, use t-test; otherwise, consider Mann-Whitney U test.
*  Example of performing a t-test (replace with Mann-Whitney U test if necessary)
```{r}
t_test_result <- t.test(RR_Interval ~ Group, data=hrv_data)
print(t_test_result)
```

##  Generalised linear model (GLM)

In this section of our analysis, we employ a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) as a more sophisticated approach to analyzing our data, as opposed to relying solely on a t-test. The example of GLM framework is chosen for several reasons:

1. **Incorporation of Multiple Covariates**: Unlike the t-test, which is limited to comparing means between two groups, GLM allows us to account for the influence of multiple covariates simultaneously. This is crucial in our study, as we're interested in understanding how factors such as age (`Age_day`), sex (`Sex`), and treatment type (`Treatment`) might impact Heart Rate Variability (HRV), alongside the primary variable of interest (Group).

2. **Flexibility in Modeling Different Types of Data**: GLM extends the general linear model to allow for response variables that have error distribution models other than a normal distribution. This makes it suitable for a wide range of data types and link functions, providing a more accurate analysis that aligns with the underlying data distribution.

3. **Ability to Handle Non-linear Relationships**: Through the use of link functions, GLMs can model relationships between the predictor and response variables that are not necessarily linear. This capability is particularly important in biomedical data, where many relationships are complex and non-linear.

4. **Direct Estimation of Effect Size and Significance**: GLMs provide direct estimates of the effect size for each covariate, including confidence intervals and p-values, making it easier to interpret the impact of each factor on the response variable. This comprehensive insight is invaluable in discerning not just if there is an effect, but how strong that effect is, and how confidently we can assert its presence.

5. **Improved Precision and Power**: By adjusting for additional covariates that might influence the response variable, GLMs can reduce unexplained variability in the data. This leads to more precise estimates of the effects of interest and potentially increases the statistical power of the analysis.

By leveraging a GLM, we're not just comparing group means; we're constructing a more nuanced understanding of how various factors contribute to differences in RR intervals, providing a deeper insight into the dynamics of heart rate variability. This approach allows us to make more informed conclusions about the data, supported by a robust statistical framework that accounts for the multifaceted nature of biological phenomena.


## Covariate data
* Simulating covariate data
```{r}
set.seed(123)  # For reproducibility

covariate_data <- data.frame(
  Sample = 1:(2*N),  # Assuming N samples per group as before
  Age_day = sample(0:60, 2*N, replace = TRUE),
  Sex = sample(0:1, 2*N, replace = TRUE),
  Treatment = sample(c("a", "b", "c"), 2*N, replace = TRUE)
)

# Combine with HRV data
hrv_data <- cbind(hrv_data, covariate_data)
head(hrv_data)
```

```{r}
# Convert necessary factors
hrv_data$Group <- as.factor(hrv_data$Group)
hrv_data$Sex <- as.factor(hrv_data$Sex)
hrv_data$Treatment <- as.factor(hrv_data$Treatment)
```

* Fit GLM model
```{r}
glm_model <- glm(RR_Interval ~ Group + Age_day + Sex + Treatment, data = hrv_data, family = gaussian())

# Summary of GLM results
summary(glm_model)
```

* Predicted vs. Actual RR Intervals Plot
* This plot shows the relationship between the actual RR intervals and the predicted RR intervals from the GLM, providing insight into the model's accuracy.
```{r}
# Calculate predicted values
hrv_data$Predicted_RR <- predict(glm_model, type = "response")

# Plot of Actual vs. Predicted RR Intervals
ggplot(hrv_data, aes(x = Predicted_RR, y = RR_Interval)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = Group), alpha = 0.6) +
  geom_abline(intercept = 0, slope = 1, linetype = "dashed", color = "red") +
  labs(title = "Actual vs. Predicted RR Intervals", x = "Predicted RR Interval (s)", y = "Actual RR Interval (s)") +
  theme_minimal()
```

* Residuals Plot
* This plot examines the residuals (differences between actual and predicted values) to check for any systematic patterns that might suggest inadequacies in the model.
```{r}
# Calculate residuals
hrv_data$Residuals <- residuals(glm_model)

# Residuals Plot
ggplot(hrv_data, aes(x = Predicted_RR, y = Residuals)) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = "dashed", color = "red") +
  geom_point(aes(color = Group), alpha = 0.6) +
  labs(title = "Residuals vs. Predicted RR Intervals", x = "Predicted RR Interval (s)", y = "Residuals") +
  theme_minimal()
```

* Effect Plot for a Single Covariate
* To illustrate the effect of a single covariate while holding others constant, you can create a plot for one covariate at a time. Here's an example for Age:
```{r}

# Assuming 'Age' is a continuous variable in your model
ggplot(hrv_data, aes(x = Age_day, y = RR_Interval)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = Group), alpha = 0.6) +
  geom_smooth(method = "glm", method.args = list(family = "gaussian"), formula = y ~ x, aes(group = Group, color = Group)) +
  labs(title = "Effect of Age on RR Interval", x = "Age (days)", y = "RR Interval (s)") +
  theme_minimal()
```

* Visualize effects of Group and Covariates on RR Interval
```{r}
ggplot(hrv_data, aes(x = Group, y = RR_Interval, color = Group)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~Sex + Treatment, scales = "free_x") +
  labs(title = "RR Interval Variability by Group with Covariates\n(sex 0/1, treatments a,b,c)", x = "Group", y = "RR Interval (s)") +
  theme_minimal()
```


## Waveform notes

### ECG simulation functions overview

The `ecg_functions.R` file includes custom functions designed for simulating Electrocardiogram (ECG) waveforms and analyzing Heart Rate Variability (HRV). These functions are used to generate synthetic ECG data, detect R peaks, simulate variability in RR intervals, and prepare data for case/control studies. The original inspiration for these functions came from the `ecg_wave` function from [Tanzir Hasan's ECG Simulation project](https://github.com/tanzirhasan/ECG_Simulation).

## Main Distribution Functions

The ECG waveform simulation leverages several key functions:

- **`ecg_wave`**: Generates individual ECG wave components (P, Q, R, S, T waves) based on Fourier series expansions. Each wave represents different phases of the heart's electrical activity.
  
- **`fit_ecg_waves_to_beats`**: Combines the individual wave functions into a complete ECG waveform over a series of heartbeats, adjusted for heart rate variability.

## Variability Functions

To analyze HRV, we introduce variability in the simulated RR intervals:

- **`simulate_rr_intervals`**: Simulates RR intervals with specified baseline and variability, representing the time between successive R peaks.

- **`rr_intervals_to_beats`**: Converts RR intervals into cumulative beats for further simulation, facilitating HRV analysis.

## Simulating Groups

For our case/control study, we simulate groups with different HRV characteristics:

- **`simulate_rr_intervals_group`**: Generates RR intervals for a specified group, incorporating baseline RR intervals and variability, useful for simulating control and case groups in our analysis.
